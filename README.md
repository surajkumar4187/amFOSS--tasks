##  My view of the tasks 
In hindsight, the tasks were actually pretty fun and a great learning experience. A lot of them were really hard for me in the start (given I had 0 CS experience) but I was able to grasp the concepts pretty quickly and figure out how to apply them for each task. I'd say these tasks gave a fantastic taste of each field of CS (which I'm aware was intentional) and having done most of them, I have a much better idea of where my interests lie now, than a month ago. 

## Introduction
Hey there! I'm Suraj Kumar, born in Chennai but brought up in Hyderabad so I'm more biryani than idli. I'm a guy who developed a recent interest in technology in general ~2 years back (around the start of the pandemic) and I don't even know how it happened, but I remember just googling every silly question that came in my mind (Reddit was and is my nest). I love solving problems just for the kick I get when I solve them, and because of that I developed an attitude of learning new stuff for the sake of learning new stuff. Adopting that kind of a  change in my mindset has definitely helped me way more than doing stuff because I was made to. I like working in teams because I like bouncing ideas off of one another, and I believe I would fit right into amzFOSS! :)
