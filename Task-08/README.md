# Internet Explorer 

#### This was a pretty fun task to do. I first had to understand how HTML, Javascript and CSS were interconnected. After that I was able to kinda figure out what was supposed to go where. Then it was just lots of googling to find out how to add this and that functionality. Pretty happy when I click on the button and a sound plays lol
