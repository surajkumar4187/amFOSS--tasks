# Introspection

## Why must we choose you?

#### Man, I'm sure if I was given these tasks to solve in a month one year back I would've laughed and given up. Over the last ~6 months, my habit of doing things just for the sake of learning something new has increased drastically. Everyday I would read about something new (and random), be it on reddit, google, or whatever(mostly tech related). I even popped open my laptop a lot just to see what's going on inside. I've noticed that learning new stuff and solving new problems seem to be big drivers for me, which is why I never got burnt out while solving the challenges. With me, once I internalise something, I make sure it's done 9/10 times - and I've internalised excelling at Amrita. Wanting to be part of amFOSS is kind of the reason I joined the Amritapuri campus. I love working in teams, and would love to be part of the amFOSS team! :) 


## What is your plan for the next 6 months?

#### I'm actually pretty lucky that I had things like the tasks to nudge me to work in a specific direction because I actually ended up being interested in some of them (App-development, program problem solving, etc.). My plan for the next 6 months is to simply dive deeper and deeper into my fields of interest (and also explore new fields), while still excelling academically. 

## How would you contribute back to the club?

#### Like I said, once I internalise something, I basically always get it done. I'm also aware of the competition to get into amFOSS, so my being in the club won't be taken for granted. I'll contribute back to the club any way I can, willing to work as long as it takes. :)

## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?

#### This is actually a pretty dope selection process. At first some challenges seem overwhelming, but it eventually just boils down to reinforcing the learning and applying habit, which is very good.
