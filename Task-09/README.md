# Krypto Scrapper 

#### This was the hardest task for me because Rust is such a language specific programming language. Like, my code kept outputting the entire HTML code of the crypto website because I forgot to add a '>p' to my CSS tag, due to which it scanned the entire division instead of just the tag I needed, that took me an hour to fix. And also finding the correct CSS tags took me a while.
